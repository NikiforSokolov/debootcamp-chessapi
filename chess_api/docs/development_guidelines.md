# Development Guidelines

This file serves as a guide for project group members contributing to this project, outlining agreed practices to ensure smooth and organized development workflow.


## Branching Strategy

- We create a separate branch for each feature or bug fix.
- Branch names are named in the following format: `username/feature_description`.
- We remove branches after merging.

## Pull Request Reviewing

- Only one approval is enough for a pull request (second approve could also come, but it's not necessary for merge).
- The branch owner is performing the merge.

## Pull Request Size

- To facilitate easier code review, we aim to keep our pull requests small and focused.
- If a feature or bug fix requires a large amount of changes, we should divide these changes into several smaller pull requests.
